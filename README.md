# RPi Temperature_Control_with_logging

This repository MASTER is my central place for my projects on temperature heating and cooling control  with  looging and remote control.  It is not recomended for anyone else to use.

Please see my  [fanshim-python](https://github.com/grayerbeard/fanshim-python) repository for a fully tested version of the Pimorini code (ver 0.0.4) with minimal adjustments to run using PWM so slower and quieter.

My next item, towards the end of december, will be to use much of the same code in an R Pi Zero controlling a Sauna Heater, after that house central heateing control to better contro system when away from home and to minimise electricity used by the gas central heating system.  Other  items in pipèline are house heat recobvery ventiñation and house temperature monitoring and community workshop electric fan heater controls.
