# Notes
# alternative_algorithm_using_quarter_spans.py  2019 12 04
# (1) Checks if temp has risen more than quarter span and sets throttle to 50 if less than 50
# (2) Checks if Fan was on keep blowing until temp less than min temp minus quarter span.
# Effect blow harder when fan comes on and for longer till cpu cooled down more.

# a python3 script to calc output parameters based on configuration and current temperature
# where the objective is limiting maximum temperature rather than maintaining a target temperature
# Slight improvement on method used for last few months put into separate class
